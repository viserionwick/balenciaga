      <p>1.2. Our General Terms will apply to any contract for the sale of Products by BALENCIAGA to you through the Website (“<strong>Contract</strong>”).</p>

      <p>1.3. The sale of Products through the Website is only available to consumers, meaning natural persons who act for purposes of personal consumption (i.e., for purposes extraneous to their trade, business, craft and profession and not for profit). If you are under the age of majority, you must expressly confirm that you have obtained the consent of a parent or legal guardian to purchase a Product, before submitting an order.</p>

      <p><a name="_Hlk94712986">1.4.</a> You will be asked to agree to our General Terms and to the Terms of Use of our Website (“ToU”) before placing an order. We therefore advise you to read these documents carefully, and in particular our General Terms, before proceeding with any purchase, and save or print a copy for future reference. If you do not agree to our General Terms and/or the ToU, you will not be able to order any Products from the Website.</p>

      <p>1.5. We reserve the right to amend or update all or part of our General Terms from time to time, and when we do so, we will publish the revised version of our General Terms and indicate the “Last Updated” date at the top of such revised General Terms. The Contract between you and us is governed by our General Terms in force at the time you place an order.</p>

      <p>1.6.

      <p><strong>2. Product Information and Availability</strong></p>

      <p>2.1. Information on our Products (along with the corresponding Product codes) and relevant prices are available on the Website.</p>

      <p>2.2. Pictures of the Products displayed on the Website are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the Products accurately, we cannot guarantee that a device’s display of our Products accurately reflects them. In particular, the colors, fabric, shade, grain, texture of the Products shown on your screen may vary from those on the actual Product. Therefore, you should rely exclusively on the description of the Products and their characteristics as mentioned on the Website.</p>

      <p>2.3. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit the quantities and/or types of any Products available on the Website per person, household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by, or under, the same account, the same payment method and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. You cannot purchase more than two (2) identical Products per order. The maximum number of items per order is ten (10).</p>

      <p>2.4. We may change or discontinue a Product or any of its features, as described on the Website, at any time without notice (this does not affect the Products for which an Order Confirmation, as defined below, has already been issued at the time of the change). During the purchasing process, we will inform you if your order cannot be processed, in whole or in part, due to the unavailability of one or more ordered Products. If one or more ordered Product(s) are unavailable, your order will be totally or partially cancelled (as the case may be), and you shall pay only the price of the available Product(s).</p>

      <p>2.5. In the event your connection to the Website fails, your selection of Products may be lost. In such case you will be required to re-enter your selection. Please note that Products in your shopping cart are not reserved and may be purchased by other customers.

      <p>3.2. We make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all prices for the Products displayed on the Website are correct. In the unlikely event of a Product being mispriced (incorrect price or typographical error in the price shown), we will cancel your order and terminate the Contract.</p>

      <p>3.3. Without prejudice to the above, we reserve the right to change the Products prices at any time and without notice, but such changes will not apply to Products for which we have received a purchase order.</p>

This email does not mean, however, that your order has been accepted by us. We may choose, on legitimate grounds, not to accept your order, in whole or in part, without liability to you. Examples of non-acceptance of your orders are as follows:</p>

      <p>(i) We are unable to obtain authorization for your payment; or</p>

      <p><strong>5. Payment</strong></p>

      <p>5.1. We accept payments made in the currency specified for the country of the shipping destination with the payment methods proposed to you before you confirm your order.

These terms and conditions can be found by clicking on the link communicated to you before you confirm your order. We accept no liability in respect of your use of the payment method concerned.

      <p>5.2. We may offer various methods of cryptocurrency payment from time to time in certain countries at our discretion (“Payment Methods”), including, without limitation, BitPay, Inc. (“BitPay”). If you decide to utilize one of these Payment Methods, payments are to be made in one of the cryptocurrencies expressly offered via such Payment Methods.

Such personal data will be subject to the applicable payment processor’s privacy policies, for which we bear no responsibility. In addition, you may be required to use a cryptocurrency wallet with respect to any cryptocurrency payments.</p>

      <p>5.4. In the event a payment is made through BitPay, BitPay will lock in the applicable cryptocurrency exchange rate during checkout for a limited period of time to enable you to complete your payment. Payments not completed during this time window will not be associated with your purchase, and you will need to contact BitPay to request a refund (less the corresponding miner, gas and transaction fees). For further information on such “Orphan Payments” and other “Payment Exceptions” that may occur, such as “Underpayments” or “Overpayments,” please refer to BitPay’s Shopper Terms of Use, as provided above.</p>

      <p><strong>9. Right of withdrawal and Returns</strong></p>

      <p>9.1. You have the right to withdraw from the Contract without giving a reason within thirty (30) days from the date on which you (or the person designated by you) take physical possession of the Products or, in case of multiple packages delivered for the same order, the last package delivered.</p>

      <p>9.2. The right of withdrawal does not apply to orders for personalized Products and for Products identified on our Website as non-returnable (“ <strong>Non-returnable Products</strong>”) without prejudice to your statutory rights according to Section 11.</p>

      <p>9.3. To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us (BALENCIAGA AMERICA 65 Bleecker Street 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor 10012 New York United States - <a href="mailto:clientservice.us@balenciaga.com"> clientservice.us@balenciaga.com </a> – phone number at +1 646 889 1895) of your decision to withdraw from the Contract by an unequivocal statement by:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>e-mail to <a href="mailto:clientservice.us@balenciaga.com"> clientservice.us@balenciaga.com </a> <u>,</u></li>
        <li>post to BALENCIAGA AMERICA 65 Bleecker Street 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor 10012 New York United States, or</li>
        <li>online.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send the communication concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired (see Section 9.1).</p>

      <p>9.4. If you withdraw from the Contract, we shall refund you all amounts received from you, including the delivery charges, (except the additional costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive delivery method we offer), without undue delay and in any event not later than fourteen (14) days from the date on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will refund you using the same payment method that you used when you placed your initial order, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement. We may withhold reimbursement until we have received the Products back.</p>

      <p>9.5. In the event of a cancellation or return of an order placed using cryptocurrency payments, we shall refund you for all amounts received from you for such product, less any transactional fees (including, without limitation, applicable miner and gas fees) that may have been charged by the payment processor as well as any service-related fees that you may have ordered. We will refund you in the same form of cryptocurrency and using the same Payment Method that you used when placing your initial order, and the refund shall be directed to the account used at the time of initial payment. We may withhold reimbursement until our receipt of the returned products, if applicable. Refunds made through BitPay will be issued for the full US or Canadian Dollar value, as applicable, of the applicable product and in the same form of cryptocurrency used in the initial payment, which shall be processed at such cryptocurrency’s exchange rate in effect at the time the refund is completed (as determined by BitPay and set forth on its website). By way of example, if the applicable product price was USD$1,000 and the applicable cryptocurrency exchange rate at the time of purchase was USD$1,000 to 1 BTC, then you would have paid 1 BTC. If the applicable cryptocurrency exchange rate at the time the refund is issued subsequently reflects USD$500 to 1 BTC, then you will receive 2 BTC (less BitPay’s transactional fees). Or, if the applicable cryptocurrency exchange rate at the time the refund is issued subsequently reflects USD$2,000 to 1 BTC, then you will receive 0.5 BTC (less BitPay’s transactional fees). You agree to assume the volatility risk of the cryptocurrency value.</p>

      <p>9.6 You shall send back the Products or hand them over to us to the address indicated in the instructions enclosed with the return label, without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate your withdrawal from the Contract to us.

      <p>9.7. The Products shall be returned in their original condition, unaltered, unused, undamaged, in their original packaging and with original tags and labels attached along with all accessories and related documents (e.g., instructions booklet, Product certificates, etc.) if any, and undamaged box, if applicable.</p>

      <p>9.8. If a returned Product does not meet the conditions for its return, as listed in Section 9.7 above, we will send back such Product to you to the address you indicated in the return form, or if such address is not valid, to the address communicated by you when you placed the order. This return will occur within fourteen (14) days from the date we informed you of the rejection of the returned Products, unless a force majeure event, an event beyond our reasonable control or any unforeseeable circumstance occurs.</p>

      <p>9.9. You are liable for any diminished value of the Products resulting from the handling other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the Products.</p>

      <p>9.10.
